# Implementation of a replicated service using State Machine Replication relying on the Multi Paxos protocol.

### Made by:

* [Daniel Flamino](https://github.com/DanielFlamino)
* Diogo SilvÃ©rio
* [Rita Macedo](https://github.com/ritama)

### Folder Content:
```
README.md -> this file

docs/2nd Phase Report.pdf -> the project report

akka-project/ -> the actual project

akka-project/src/main/resources/aplication.conf -> application configuration

akka-project/test.sh -> script to launch the initial replicas and clients

akka-project/target/pack/bin/main -> the application (after compiling)
```

### Notes:

* The test.sh script was made to run on git-bash for Windows and might not work
for other OS/terminal combos. It uses hard coded IP addresses and ports for
the tester which must be changed before running it. Same applies to the 
aplication.conf file with the set of initial replicas

* The project must be compiled using `sbt pack` before running it.

* For a list of available project commands, type `help` once the app is up and
running.
